    <h1>My Interests</h1>
    <a href="index.html">Home</a>
    <p>As a computer engineering student, I am highly interested in coding and stuff and in fact I chose computer engineering because of my interest in coding and stuff. Apart from coding, I like badminton and table tennis in sports and to be honest, I am really a bad player. I am also interested in cars and how they work and how different small small parts like valves, fuel injector, spark plug, etc works synchronously to run an engine so smoothly really fascinates me. My dream cars are Toyota Supra and Ford F-150. Last but not the least, I believe in ICE supremacy.</p>
